# Scintillation

This repository contains code used to create, and analyse dynamic spectra.  Analysis cases are typically developed on a case-by-case basis and rarely identical, so the main utility is to get to clean dynamic spectra / secondary spectra.

To use the code within, you must first have folded archive, psrfits files, or .dspec files produced by psrflux.  To start directly from archives, you will need the use of 'psrchive' along with its python bindings: I have found the easiest way is using the conda installation:  https://github.com/conda-forge/dspsr-feedstock



I have given previous walkthroughs to the Fundamental Physics group at Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, here:
